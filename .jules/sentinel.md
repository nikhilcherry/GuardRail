## 2024-01-11 - Enforce HTTPS in Release Mode
**Vulnerability:** The `AuthService` allowed HTTP requests if the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable was configured with an `http://` scheme. In a production environment, this would expose user credentials (password, OTP) and authentication tokens to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
**Learning:** Even if `AndroidManifest.xml` disables `allowBackup`, insecure network traffic configurations can still leak sensitive data. Developers often fallback to defaults or misconfigure environment variables.
**Prevention:** Implemented a strict check in `AuthService` that inspects the URL scheme. If the app is in Release mode (`!kDebugMode`) and the scheme is not `https`, the request is blocked before it leaves the device. This creates a defense-in-depth layer that protects against misconfiguration.
